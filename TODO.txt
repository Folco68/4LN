- ensure source dir still exists when refreshing
- race condition: cloning can be performed between analyze and Window diff pop up

// Path/directory
static  toNAtiveSeparator()   -> make / become \ on Windows
static  cleanPath()           -> remove last \ or /, . and .. Keep symlinks. Use '/' for any platform
        canonicalPath()       -> remove ., .. and symlinks

=> Prefer QDir::cleanPath(Qdir(xyz).canonicalPath());
